# What is Creative Coding?

Creative Coding is a loosely defined term used to describe a wide range of artistic practices that use computer code as a medium. Creative Code typically distinguishes itself from regular coding by the fact that it doesn't follow pre-defined specifications to solve problems for a user, but rather aims at expressing ideas and concepts.

# Where does it come from?

There is a rich history of artists using computers as a tool, going back all the way to the 1970s. People like Vera Molnar, [Frieder Nake](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/agent/68), [Lillian Schwartz](https://vimeo.com/98960229), Manfred Mohr, many of them still active today. They used computer code to generate complex visuals, drawings, animations, or music.

# Why this document?

Getting started in any new field can feel overwhelming. This page is the opposite of the "awesome" curated lists that are popular on Github. Rather than an exhaustive compilation of every resource on the internet, it is deliberately incomplete and opinionated. For each of the profiles below, we hand picked one tool, one artist, one book, and one website to get your started on your journey.


<!-- ## musician

If you use Ableton Live, you can make instruments by [Max4Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) ready to be used in your set. (any examples?)
 -->


## I want to make music!

#### One tool: TidalCycles
[TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) is a programming environment to generate sound by code, but just like playing a DJ set. The code is very simple - `sound "bd"` will play the bass drum as a loop, and `sound "hh" # cutoff 1000` plays the hi-hat with cutoff (low-pass) filter at 1000 Hz. and you can ask questions on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xCbbhBf7YU).

<!-- Also, [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is a great tool to quickly create visuals for your musical performance! -->

#### One artist: Malitzin Cortes a.k.a. CNDSD
[Malitzin Cortes](http://malitzincortes.net/)'s work is developed between live coding, live cinema, installation, Virtual Reality, generative art, sound design, experimental music and sound art.

#### One artist: Anna Carreras
“[Anna Carreras](https://www.annacarreras.com/) (Barcelona, 1979) is a creative coder and digital artist interested in experimentation on interactive communication focusing her work on the use of generative algorithms, creative code and interactive technology as a means of communication and an experience generator.”

## I want to make visuals

#### One tool: Hydra

[Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is a programming environment to rapidly create visuals on the browser by a small amount of code. `osc().out()` generates a sine wave pattern, and `osc().color(1,0,0).out()` changes the color to red.

#### One tool: anything on your computer!

[Isadora](https://troikatronix.com/) is used by a lot of dancers and choreographers for media performances - generating geometric patterns, mixing with video feed and using cameras for interactivity. You don't need to code - you can create visuals and logic simply by connecting boxes.

#### One website: Motion Bank
[Motion Bank](http://motionbank.org/) is a spin-off of the Forsythes Company and currently situated at Hochschule Mainz. On the website, there is an archive of past projects including a research project with [Deborah Hay](http://scores.motionbank.org/dh/#/set/sets).


## I want to make games!

#### One tool: Bitsy
